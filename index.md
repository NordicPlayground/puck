Raspberry Pi took the maker community by storm when it launched in 2012.
With its internet access it allowed small projects to be internet-of-things enabled.
We have created a platform to take this one step further.

Our platform, called the Puck platform, is an internet of things platform for mbed.
mbed makes it easy to program embedded hardware for people new to embedded systems.
Our platform is built upon the first mbed chip with Bluetooth, created by Nordic Semiconductor.
We hope to create a community around these BLE devices where people contribute to the project, and share their designs with each other. Everything is open-source, of course, with lots of supporting materials.

> The Raspberry Pi of Bluetooth

We make it easy to rapidly prototype and develop Bluetooth LE enabled devices - get up and running in under 10 lines of code, written directly in the browser.


Whether you want to monitor your door to tell if it's open or closed, or maybe your want to text your wife when you leave work, together, now's the time to make that project.

We've developed a handful of awesome examples to demonstrate the platform. These examples are named 'Pucks'.
By talking to the internet through your smartphone, the barrier to creating your own Internet of Things device is lower than ever.

We have [tutorials](tutorials.html) on how each of these pucks are made that you can find on this webpage.
All these pucks are made possible by the [nRF51822](http://www.semiconductorstore.com/cart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=49226), a Bluetooth-enabled mbed development board. [Buy it here to get started!](http://www.semiconductorstore.com/cart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=49226).

**The basic puck!**

All pucks act as beacons, broadcasting information to any device nearby. Leave a puck in your bedroom, and your smartphone can automatically go to silent mode for the night, as well as set an alarm for the following day.

**The cube puck!** With a single rotation you can change the function of the room you're in.

- Want the movie to pause or the music to turn off? Rotate the cube.
- Want to set a timer for 5 minutes? Rotate the cube.
- Want the A/C to be a tiny bit colder? Rotate the cube.

**The IR puck!** Command any infrared device.

The 'IR Puck' can mimic arbitrary infrared remote controls, and receive commands over Bluetooth. This enables your smartphone to control other devices like TVs, DVD-players and air-conditioners.

Use this together with the cube, and the cube becomes a remote control for your IR equipment.

**The display puck!** Display any text or black/white image on an e-paper display.

Display the current weather on this puck when you're nearby, or display an up-to-date bus schedule at any time for your local bus stop. The possibilities are endless!

To get started making your own pucks, you can have a look at our [location puck tutorial](tutorials/location.html).
